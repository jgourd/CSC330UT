        "The second requirement is that the recursive algorithm must change its state so that it moves the algorithm **toward** the base case. A change of state means that some data that the algorithm is using is modified. Usually the data that represents our problem gets smaller in some way. In the `calc_sum()` function, our primary data structure is a list; therefore, we must focus our efforts on the list. Since the base case is a list of length 1, a natural progression toward the base case is to shorten the list. This is exactly what happens on line 5 of the code above (i.e., the `calc_sum()` function is called with a shorter list).\n",

        "When the turtle is created, it also creates a window for itself to draw in. The `spiral()` function is implemented recursively. The base case for this simple function is when the length of the line we want to draw, as given by the `length` parameter, is reduced to zero (or less). If the length of the line is longer than zero, the turtle is instructed to go forward by `length` units and then turn right 90 degrees. The recursive step is when the `spiral()` function is called again with a reduced length.\n",

We could say that a tree is a trunk, with a smaller tree going off to the right and another smaller tree going off to the left. If you think of this definition recursively it means that we will apply the recursive definition of a tree to both of the smaller left and right trees. And this could go on many times. For example, a branch going off to the left is just a smaller tree with even smaller trees branching off of it -- and so on.\n",

On line 9 we make the recursive call right after the turtle turns to the right by 20 degrees; this is the right tree mentioned above. Then on line 11, the turtle makes another recursive call, but this time after turning left by 40 degrees. The reason the turtle must turn left by 40 degrees is that it needs to undo the original 20 degree turn to the right and then do an additional 20 degree turn to the left in order to draw the left tree. Also notice that each time we make a recursive call to tree, we subtract some amount from the `length` parameter. This is to make sure that the recursive trees get smaller and smaller. You should also recognize the initial *if*-statement on line 6 as a check for the base case of `length` getting too small."

        "The source code is probably a bit more complex than it should be. It's also probably best executed on a local machine instead of in this *colab*. There's a lot of extra code to help show how the recursion is working (e.g., the indicators), to enable pausing after each move and waiting for user input before continuing, clearing the screen as moves are made to animate the process, and so on. Let's try to explain a few things:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The `__getitem__()` function in the `Maze` class is used to allow indexing into a `Maze` object. For example, `maze[0]` returns the first item in (i.e., row of) the maze. Therefore, `maze[0][4]`, for example, returns the fifth column of the first row of the maze.\n",
        "* The `is_exit()` function merely determines if the position is at the edge of the maze (i.e., the top row, bottom row, left column, or right column). Exits are always at the perimeter of the maze.\n",
        "* The `solve()` function does the bulk of the work here. Other than code that animates, waits for user input, etc, here's what's going on:\n",
        "  * If the current position is an obstacle, a dead end, or has been visited already (i.e., it has a bread crumb or an indicator), then we cannot explore in this direction. We return `False`, and the recursive call ends.\n",
        "  * If the current position is an exit, then we have solved the maze! We return `True`, and the recursive call ends.\n",
        "  * Otherwise, this position has not yet been visited, so we leave a breadcrumb. We then try going N (placing an indicator pointing in that direction before going to the N position). This begins a new recursive call.\n",
        "  * If that got us nowhere (i.e., the N recursive call ended with `False` being returned), we try going S (changing the indicator to point in that direction before going to the S position). This begins a new recursive call.\n",
        "  * If that got us nowhere (i.e., the S recursive call ended with `False` being returned), we try going W (changing the indicator to point in that direction before going to the W position). This begins a new recursive call.\n",
        "  * If that got us nowhere (i.e., the W recursive call ended with `False` being returned), we try going E (changing the indicator to point in that direction before going to the E position). This begins a new recursive call.\n",
        "  * If that got us nowhere (i.e., the E recursive call ended with `False` being returned), we have tried all possible directions and place a dead end marker in the position.\n",
        "  * As the recursive calls end, each one will reach the end of the `solve()` function. If any position was successful (i.e., `True` was returned), then we place an exit marker in the position. Of course, this will occur for all positions that lead to the exit."
