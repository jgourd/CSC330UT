Test your Binary program with:
-binary1.txt
-binary2.txt

Test your Caesar program with:
-caesar1.txt: The shift is 17 and the alphabet is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
-caesar2.txt: The shift is 33 and the alphabet is aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ0123456789-_ =

Test your Vigenere program with:
-vigenere1.txt: The key is abc123., and the alphabet is aAbBcCdDeEfFgGhHiIjJkKlLmMnNoOpPqQrRsStTuUvVwWxXyYzZ0123456789-_ =
-vigenere2.txt: The key is myKEYis31337 and the alphabet is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.,=_zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba

Test your XOR program with:
-ciphertext1.bin: The key is key1.bin
-ciphertext2.bin: The key is key2.bin
-ciphertext3.bin: The key is key3.bin
-ciphertext4.bin: The key is key4.bin (note that the key is smaller than the ciphertext, so it will need to be repeated as needed)

Test everything (!) with:
-super input.txt
